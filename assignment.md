## Code source

All code is original content and available in `analysis.ipynb`. It works for my environment and on GitHub, so there's no reason it shouldn't work for you if you run everything sequentially.

## Correlation chart

The correlation matrix is used to find columns that relate to each other or _correlate_. This can help brainstorm ideas for future visualizations. My code randomly chooses 20 columns from the cleaned data and analyzes the correlation. You only need to look at the data under and to the left of the red squares as it is mirrored to the other side.
