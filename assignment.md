## Correlation chart

The correlation matrix is used to find columns that relate to each other or _correlate_. This can help brainstorm ideas for future visualizations. My code randomly chooses 10 columns from the cleaned data and analyzes the correlation. You only need to look at the data under and to the left of the red squares as it is mirrored to the other side.

There are a few interesting correlations which prompt further study.
